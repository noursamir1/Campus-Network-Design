# Campus-Network-Design
Design a campus network using IP technologies for both data and voice communication. Design should include a number of sites each representing a branch of a company. Design should be validated using Cisco Packet Tracer
A campus network is typically the part of the network infrastructure that offers network connectivity services, resources and facilities to end users over a specific geographical area. 
The variance of the geographical area determines whether this network will be a LAN, WAN, PANor MAN. A good network design in general is very essential as it determines that the network works reliably at a high degree of efficiency. 
In this work, we designed a campus network using Cisco Packet Tracer as our simulation tool. Our architecture allowed for the availability of both data and voice communication.

# Hint
You are going to find the project design in a file named "IT_Campus_Network_Project.pkt" and the report that explains every part of the project in a file named "Report of_IT_Campus_Network_Project.docx".
